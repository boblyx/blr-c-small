# Small C project boilerplate
- Boilerplate for small C projects that don't require stuff like CMake.
- Describe your solution here.

## Usage
- Adjust the build script `build.sh`
- Run the build script via `bash build.sh`. 
- The script will also run the program after building is complete and successful.
- Remove the comment to also run `valgrind` to check for memory leaks.
